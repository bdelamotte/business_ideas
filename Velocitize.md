Name: Velocitize
 
Mission Statement: To streamline all types of coding processes for both the hiring company and the contractor using the latest methods in process management, Artificial Intelligence, and Test Driven Development.
 
Another way to describe it: Micro-development projects focusing on agility and quality.
 
High Level Steps:
1. 	Company wants some help writing code. They fill out the following:
a. 	Background knowledge – high level view of what this is about
b. 	Acceptance Criteria / Definition of Done – What the code must do when the project is finished.  This is a detailed summary of what needs to happen in plain English. Possible pseudo-code can be entered.
c. 	Tests that Need to be Passed – These are the stubs for all tests that are not implemented. To get the tests passing, the developer writes the code in order to make the test pass.
d. 	Project is submitted.
e. 	Coder is paid on a pull request with passing tests.
 
What makes it different:
1. 	Projects aim to never be longer than 8 hours. This incentivizes the contractor to take on a new micro-project every day for continuous payouts and gives a company quicker feedback to tweak their next set of acceptance criteria or find a new developer if the work wasn’t good.
2. 	All work should be done in a git branch.
3. 	Project should be built in something like Netlify.
4. 	Could be a DAPP.
 
 
If you write your GitHub or Jira issues a certain way, and then a single commit
1 ticket / issue to 1 PR. That is always the rule.
 
Machine learning can take the requirements in the PR and take the code in the PR and learn how to do this eventually. A bot could be used for cheaper result using AI libraries. https://openai.com/
 
How long you think it will take, how long it actually took. How much bid and ask was.
Education program / journey. How to source cheap devs for cheaper options to get them experience and have them complete things and slowly demand higher wages for more complicated features.
 
Built-in code review before payment.
 
2 Roles:
I am a Coder. I am a QAer.
Coder will provide code. QAer will provide feedback.
 
All work must be done in a Docker file
Company who is hiring must provide either a Docker file or a YAML file with dependencies and a passing tests minus the ones needing to be implemented.
